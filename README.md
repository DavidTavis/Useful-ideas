# Vivid-Ideas
	Desktop widget with some theses, ideas.
In this project, I developed an Android home screen widget. The widget contains a certain set of my life rules (ideas). The application allows you to share the idea in Facebook and to add new ideas, delete existing ones, and view the following. It is also possible to adjust the key sound or turn it off and change the time interval for updating the widget.
	In my project, I used the following stack of technologies:
		AppWidgetProvider,
		SQLite,
		Threads, Concurrency,
		Broadcast Receiver,
		Intent, PendingIntent,
		Facebook SDK,
		Observer pattern,
		Preferences, PreferenceFragment, DialogPreference, SharedPreferences
		Alarm Manager,
		Media Player,
		Toast notification,
		File, Log.
